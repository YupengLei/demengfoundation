                            Over the years, with your generous support, I have been studying for a bachelor’s degree on the cello. I am honored to have been elected as the assistant principal cellist of Curtis Symphony Orchestra. All these are inseparable from your selfless assistance.

                            Again please accept my heartfelt gratitude and all good wishes for you and your family!
